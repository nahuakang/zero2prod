# zero2prod

This is the code for following the [zero3prod book](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html).
To maximum learning outcome, I implement the corresponding
code in [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) instead of 
[Actix-Web](https://git hub.com/actix/actix-web) so as to keep myself engaged with the book.

Progress of chapter is roughly marked by the Git commits.

## Commands

The `Makefile` contains the following commands:

```sh
# Initialize Postgres DB via Docker
$ make init_db
```
